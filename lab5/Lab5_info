7 Intadd runs every 3 cycles

11 Floatadd runs every 5 cycles

12 Yes, since the processor is superscalar, starts multiple instructions every cycle?

13 The processor predicts that the program needs to do the computation and starts it before the signal is sent from the program.

14 The fadds cannot run without register renaming? The original value is copied and used since the other value is altered?

15 Floatsum: the program needs to wait for the statement to be evaluated before writing to s. Is blocked as can be seen by the red a's.

16 The execution time lasts only one clock cycle for xor while it lasts 4 for summation. Bit-wise operations are generally fast?
